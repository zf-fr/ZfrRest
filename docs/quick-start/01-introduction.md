# Quick start

## Introduction

ZfrRest is a module that aims to simplify the creation of RESTful applications. It is tightly integrated to
Doctrine\Common interfaces. Therefore, people already using Doctrine (ORM, ODMâ€¦) can start to write ZfrRest with nearly no code.

## Initial setup

Once you have installed the module and copied the `zfr_rest.global.php` file into your `autoloader` folder, it's start
to configure it. This file contains a lot of options (nearly everything can be configured in ZfrRest!), but we are
going to update the `object_manager` key. As I said earlier, ZfrRest is based on `Doctrine\Common` interfaces, where
the object manager is an object that is used as a persistence layer.

If you are using DoctrineORMModule, the setup is pretty easy:

```php
return array(
    'zfr_rest' => array(
        'object_manager' => 'doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default'
    )
);
```

Users of DoctrineMongoODMModule:

```php
return array(
	'zfr_rest' => array(
		'object_manager' => 'doctrine.documentmanager.odm_default'
	)
);
```

Users that are not using Doctrine can [learn more in the cook-book](../cook-book.md) about how to use with other
persistence layer like Zend\Db.

[In next part](02-define-entity.md), you are going to define your entity.
