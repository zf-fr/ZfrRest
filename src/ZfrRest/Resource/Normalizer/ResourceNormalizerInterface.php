/**
 * RESTful API are used in various of contexts. Often, you will use your own API with a JavaScript MVC framework
 * like EmberJS, AngularJS or ExtJS. Most of those frameworks have some kind of integrated tools to handle
 * communication with your server. However, they all have different conventions which make it hard to work with,
 * because you must write a lot of boilerplate code to normalize/denormalize data.
 *
 * For instance, Ember-Data expects your payload to be sent by wrapping the resource data around a key whose name
 * is the resource name, as well as providing underscore_separated keys.
