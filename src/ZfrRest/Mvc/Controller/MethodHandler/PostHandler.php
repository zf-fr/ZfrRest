     * POST method is used to create a new resource. On successful creation, POST method should return a HTTP status
     * 201, with a Location header containing the URL of the newly created resource. We are doing several things for the
     * user automatically:
     *      - we validate post data with the input filter defined in metadata
     *      - we hydrate valid data
     *      - we pass the object to the post method of the controller
     *
     * As you can see, the post method have three arguments: the object that is inserted, the resource metadata and
     * the resource itself (which is the Collection where the object is added)
     *
     * Note that if you have set "auto_validate" and/or "auto_hydrate" to false in ZfrRest config, those steps will
     * do nothing
